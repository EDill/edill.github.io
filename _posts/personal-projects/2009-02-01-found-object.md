This pendant was a final project for one semester of jewelry and metals. The assignment was delivered one step at a time: first you cast a found object in silver, then you create a frame that covers 2-3 sides of the found object. Next you create a seperate piece that mirrors your frame, and tthen (surprise) connect the two. 

The found object I chose is a clementine peel, if you can't tell. (Insert Dad joke about this being the most expensive clementine you'll ever eat.)
