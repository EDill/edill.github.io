##What it is
Every few months, Paperless Post has hack days called "Stampy Day" (Stampy is one of our internal mascots). For the last two sets of Stampy Days, I've been working on a project called Snacks2u. 

Snacks2u is an internal product that allows our office management team to collect employee feedback on beer and snacks by presenting a curated list of provisions from our providers, and allowing employees to +1 or -1 as they see fit.

##Dev cycles
As of August 1 2015, we've made it through two iterations, and are preparing for our third.

**Cycle 1**
_March 2015_
- Build out the basic frontend
   - Products are visible in list view, can be filtered by type (snack vs. beer)
- Integrate our primary provider's data
   - They don't have an API, we have to scrape it
- Implement fetch functionality that scrapes provider for current inventory, allowing admins to create a new poll
- Build out basic authentication and two user states: admin and non-admin
   - Restricted authentication to only Paperless Post employees

**Cycle 2**
_May 2015_
- Integrate a new provider's inventory
- Add a "publish" button to allow admins to select all items before making the list live
- Build an admin-only tool for managing users/granting admin access
- Implement batching whenever admins fetch new inventory
   - Unclear how we'd use this, but you never know
- Add a new, fancier gif for the login screen

**Cycle 3**
_August 2015_
- Integrate yet another new provider (we have API access this time! Thanks, Drizly!)
- Build out fuzzy search for admins
- Implement pagination
- Add a loader
- Give admins the ability to close a poll, and built out a closed state for non-admins


##PMing hack days
Most of my hack day work is planning, testing, building powerpoints, and combing through pages of snack gifs and cat pictures. Here's one of my best finds, which was used as a placeholder while we built out the model:
