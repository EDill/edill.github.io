##What it is
Every few months, Paperless Post has hack days called "Stampy Day" (Stampy is one of our internal mascots). For the last two sets of Stampy Days, I've been working on a project called Snacks2u. 

Snacks2u is an internal product that allows our office management team to collect employee feedback on beer and snacks by presenting a curated list of provisions from our providers, and allowing employees to +1 or -1 as they see fit.

##Dev cycles
As of August 1 2015, we've made it through two iterations, and are preparing for our third.

**Cycle 1**
_March 2015_


**Cycle 2**
_May 2015_



##PMing hack days
Being a largely non-technical PM, most of my hack day work is planning, testing, building powerpoints, and combing through pages of snack gifs and cat pictures. Here's one of my best finds, which was used as a placeholder while we built out the model:
